# C Programming Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for problems from the following courses:
- **ICS (Introduction to Computer Systems)**
- **SPL (Structured Programming Language)**

The solutions are implemented in **C programming language** and cover fundamental related to computer systems and structured programming.

### SPL (Structured Programming Language)
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Control Flow (Loops and Conditionals)
- Functions and Recursion
- Arrays and Strings
- Pointers and Dynamic Memory
- File Handling in C
